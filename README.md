# Applied Math Assignments
Repository of Constance Wang's AMATH482 project assignments covering various computational methods for data analysis in both MATLAB (HW1-HW4) and Python (HW5, Jupyter Notebook)

## Projects
The collection of project assignments for this course includes work using:
> Fourier Transforms,
> Gabor Transforms,
> Spectrograms,
> Singular Value Decomposition (SVD),
> Principal Component Analysis (PCA),
> Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA),
> Neural Networks (in Python)

## Getting Started
Navigating through each folder, each project contains the PDF of the problem statement given (spec), a PDF of the write-up and analysis conducted (report), and finally the code used to complete the project (matlab or python)

## Getting Help
Please contact repository owner Constance Wang if you have any questions about any of the content
